## Coding Style

This repo follows the Eslint Style. To ensure this, a pre-commit hook is run that uses lint-staged first reformats staged files using Prettier (mainly for line-length) and then runs standard --fix on the reformatted code. This ensures that all code that gets committed reads in as similar a way as possible.
